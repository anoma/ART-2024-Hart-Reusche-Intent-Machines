\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced intent machines, formulated them in the abstract using coalgebras, defined their most general notions of composition, demonstrated a toy example, and defined notions of such machines for barter. These efforts seek to define a minimal formulation for which the game theory of intent solving can be formulated.
